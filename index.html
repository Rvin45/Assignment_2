  <h3>1. Public Transport Role</h3>
  <div class="row align-items-center mb-5">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <p>Public transport is the lifeline of a growing city - shaping how people move, work, and connect. 
        In Melbourne, Metro Trains plays a central role in keeping the city moving, with millions of daily 
        commuters depending on it for accessibility and sustainability. 
        In the 2023-24 financial year, Metro Trains recorded over <b>182 million passenger</b> boardings, 
        a massive number to say the least, to put it to scale, MCG can hold up to <b>100,000 people, multiply that by 180</b>. 
        This scale of movement reflects not just the city's 
        reliance on rail transport, but its contribution to <b>
          easing congestion, reducing emissions, and
          connecting communities
        </b> across metropolitan Melbourne. 
        The visualisation here uses üèüÔ∏è icons - each representing approximately 10 million journeys (or 10 MCGs) ‚Äî 
        to illustrate the magnitude of these annual boardings and the enduring importance of a robust public transport network in supporting an interconnected, sustainable city.</p>

  <p class="px-5">Yet, behind these impressive numbers lies a network that must constantly adapt to Melbourne‚Äôs shifting rhythms. Demand for train services is far from uniform ‚Äî it surges during weekday peaks, dips through quiet midday hours, and fluctuates dramatically across weekends and holidays. Each line, station, and hour presents a different challenge for scheduling, staffing, and infrastructure. This variation reveals the true complexity of managing an urban rail system: balancing capacity with efficiency, ensuring reliability during rush hours, and maintaining accessibility during off-peak periods.
The visualisation below explores these swings in passenger demand across different times of day and days of the week, highlighting how even a system that moves millions must finely tune its operations to the pulse of the city.</p>
