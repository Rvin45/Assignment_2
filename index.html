          Public transport is the lifeline of a growing city ‚Äî shaping how people move, work, and connect. 
          In Melbourne, Metro Trains plays a central role in keeping the city moving, with millions of daily 
          commuters depending on it for accessibility and sustainability. 
          In the 2023‚Äì24 financial year, Metro Trains recorded over <b>182 million passenger</b> boardings ‚Äî 
          a massive number to say the least. To put it to scale, the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) can hold up to 
          <b>100,000 people</b>; multiply that by <b>180</b>. 
          This scale reflects not just the city‚Äôs reliance on rail transport, but its contribution to 
          <b>easing congestion, reducing emissions, and connecting communities</b> across metropolitan Melbourne. 
          The visualisation here uses üèüÔ∏è icons ‚Äî each representing approximately 10 million journeys (or 10 MCGs) ‚Äî 
          to illustrate the magnitude of these annual boardings and the importance of a robust public transport network 
          in supporting an interconnected, sustainable city.

      <!-- Explanation -->
      <div class="col-md-5">
        <p>
          Melbourne‚Äôs rail network continues to evolve alongside the city‚Äôs changing rhythms. 
          Passenger demand is <b>uneven throughout the day</b> ‚Äî rising sharply during <b>weekday peaks</b>, easing during <b>midday hours</b>, and <b>shifting across weekends and holidays</b>. 
          Each <b>line</b>, <b>station</b>, and <b>time period</b> presents unique challenges for <b>scheduling</b>, <b>staffing</b>, and <b>infrastructure planning</b>. 
          This variation highlights the ongoing task of <b>balancing capacity and efficiency</b>, <b>maintaining reliability during busy times</b>, and <b>ensuring accessibility during quieter periods</b>. 
          The visualisation below illustrates these <b>patterns in passenger demand</b> by <b>time of day</b> and <b>day of the week</b>, showing how the network continuously adjusts to serve the <b>city‚Äôs dynamic movement</b>.

    <p class="pb-2">
      To better understand the <b>complexity of scheduling and managing train operations</b>, the heatmap below shows the <b>number of train departures</b> on each line at different <b>times of day</b>. 
      It highlights how <b>multiple lines operate simultaneously</b> across the network ‚Äî with some sections reaching up to <b>400 train departures per hour</b> on the same track, and it is safe to say that there is a pattern to best accomodate Melbourne's ever changing lifestyle

  <section class="mb-5">
    <h3>3. Complexity & Challenges of Public Transport </h3>

    <p>
    Previously, we have established that creating a <b>network of trains</b> in a city as large and dynamic as Melbourne is an <b>incredibly complex task</b>. 
    Now, let's take a closer look at what this complexity truly means in practice. 
    Beyond simply laying tracks and scheduling services, it involves <b>coordinating thousands of train movements</b>, <b>balancing peak-hour demand</b>, and <b>maintaining reliable service</b> across an extensive and evolving network. 
    Every station, line, and connection point must operate in harmony to ensure that passengers can travel <b>efficiently, safely, and on time</b>. 
    By zooming in to the finer details, we can better appreciate the <b>interconnected systems</b> and <b>careful planning</b> that keep Melbourne‚Äôs rail network running smoothly each day.
    </p>

    <div class="row align-items-center" style="margin-bottom: 5rem;">
      <div class="col-md-3 ">
          <p>
          Here is a <b>proportional symbol map</b> of Melbourne‚Äôs train network, illustrating the <b>number of passengers</b> boarding at each station. 
          Each circle represents a station, with its size corresponding to the <b>volume of annual passengers</b>. 
          This visualisation highlights just how <b>extensive the network truly is</b> ‚Äî stretching across suburbs, business hubs, and residential areas ‚Äî and how much ground it must cover to keep the city moving efficiently. 
          The larger symbols reveal key interchange and city-center stations that handle a significant share of the network‚Äôs load, while smaller ones show the quieter outer-suburban stops that still play a vital role in ensuring <b>connectivity and accessibility</b> across Melbourne.
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>
        However, the reach of the <b>metropolitan train network</b> in Melbourne is not perfect. 
        As shown in this <b>bin map</b>, there are still many <b>suburban areas</b> where access to a train station requires travelling a considerable distance. 
        These gaps highlight the ongoing challenge of ensuring <b>equitable transport accessibility</b> across the city ‚Äî especially in outer suburbs where population growth continues to outpace infrastructure development. 
        Improving these connections is essential to support a more <b>connected, sustainable, and inclusive</b> urban transport system for all Melburnians.
        </p>
      </div>


    </div>

      <p>
      Finally, it‚Äôs important to recognise that <b>Public Transport Victoria (PTV)</b> operates as a <b>heavily subsidised government service</b>. 
      The revenue from ticket sales and commercial activities covers only a <b>fraction of the total operating cost</b> ‚Äî approximately <b>$1.1 billion annually</b>. 
      With operational expenses continuing to rise, the system relies on <b>substantial government funding</b> to maintain and expand services. 
      This heavy dependence highlights the <b>critical role of public investment</b> in sustaining Melbourne‚Äôs transport network and ensuring that it remains <b>affordable, reliable, and accessible</b> for all. 
      However, it also means that the <b>future of public transport</b> ‚Äî including new projects, upgrades, and service improvements ‚Äî lies largely in the <b>hands of government priorities and budget allocations</b>. 
      Balancing these financial pressures with the growing demand for <b>greener, more efficient transport options</b> will be a defining challenge for the years ahead.
